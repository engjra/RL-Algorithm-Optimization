# RL-Algorithm-Optimization

This project demonstrates the use of various algorithmic techniques and Reinforcement Learning to optimize sorting algorithms. The code compares the efficiency of traditional sorting algorithms with a Reinforcement Learning-based approach.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Traditional Algorithms:**
  - Bubble Sort (Brute Force)
  - Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer)
  - Fibonacci (Dynamic Programming)
  - Huffman Coding (Greedy Approach)
  - N-Queens Problem (Backtracking)
- **Reinforcement Learning:**
  - Uses PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) to train an agent to sort arrays.
  - Custom Gym environment for sorting tasks.
  
- **Time Complexity Analysis:**
  - A graphical comparison of time complexities for **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Fibonacci** (O(nÂ²), O(n log n), and O(2^n) respectively) is provided.
  - **Logarithmic scaling** is used to visualize the growth of time complexities as the input size increases.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
